About Us — “Who We Are & Why We Care”
At the New Energy Initiative, we believe knowledge is power — literally.
We’re not a utility company, and we don’t sell panels. We educate, inform, and connect homeowners with the tools and resources to make smarter energy choices.
Our mission is built on three core promises: - Clarity — clear answers about energy use and savings options. - Confidence — empowering homeowners to make informed choices. - Control — helping families reduce waste and lower monthly bills.
Together, we’re creating a movement of proactive homeowners taking back control of their homes, budgets, and future.

The Summit 360 Approach™ — “Your Complete Home Energy Roadmap”
The Summit 360 Approach™ was designed to help homeowners see the full picture of their home’s energy use — and fix what matters most.
Step 1: Home Energy Assessment — Discover where your home is wasting energy.
Step 2: Efficiency Upgrades — Seal leaks, improve insulation, and update outdated systems.
Step 3: Renewable Power Options — Explore solar, battery storage, and other clean energy technologies.
Step 4: Long-Term Energy Management — Add smart tech to monitor and control energy use daily.
With this holistic approach, you first reduce how much energy you use, and then reduce the cost of the energy you still need.
